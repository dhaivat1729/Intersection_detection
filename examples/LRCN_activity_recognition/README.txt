This code should help you reimplement the experiments in:

Donahue, J., Hendricks, L. A., Guadarrama, S., Rohrbach, M., Venugopalan, S., Saenko, K., & Darrell, T. (2014). Long-term recurrent convolutional networks for visual recognition and description. arXiv preprint arXiv:1411.4389.
Chicago	

Please see http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~lisa_anne/LRCN_video for detailed instructions on how to reimplement experiments and download pre-trained models.

**This code is built on a very old version of Caffe (2014!!!).  Updating this code is on my todo list, but realistically will not happen until summer 2017.  Be warned that you will have issues if you try to use new version of cudnn.**
